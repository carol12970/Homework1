Hello everyone. My name is Carol Romero Rodriguez, and I am a lawyer from Peru.
**Motivation:** I decided to join this course because I want to explore my talent and discover my purpose within the IT world. Technology has always sparked my curiosity, and I believe this course will help me challenge myself, expand my horizons, and find ways to connect my background in law with new opportunities in tech.
**Computer Experience:** My current computer experience is mostly professional use â€” preparing legal documents, using Excel, research, communication, and managing case-related data. While I am not a technical expert yet, I am eager to learn and grow in this new area.
